This is my repository for all of the assignments and quizes that I will have to do in Coursera's 5 course Specilization *Data Science: Foundations using R*

You can find the course link in [Coursera's Data Science: Foundations using R ](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-foundations-r)

Each folder represents a Course and each subfolder represents the week of the course. Then in each week you will find the material used to produce the assignments and to respond the quizes.
