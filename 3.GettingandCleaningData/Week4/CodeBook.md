"subject": this is the id of the subject (there were 30 subjects so thid variables ranges from 1 to 30)
"activity": the activity that each subject did (these were: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_downstairs, Walking_Upstairs)
"mean_accelerometer_time_body_x_axis": this is the total mean of the x axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
"mean_accelerometer_time_body_y_axis": this is the total mean of the y axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
"mean_accelerometer_time_body_z_axis": this is the total mean of the z axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
"std_accelerometer_time_body_x_axis": this is the total mean of the x axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
"std_accelerometer_time_body_y_axis": this is the total mean of the y axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
"std_accelerometer_time_body_z_axis": this is the total mean of the z axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity.
