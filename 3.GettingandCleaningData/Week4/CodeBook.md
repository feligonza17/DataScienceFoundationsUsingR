* _"subject"_: this is the id of the subject (there were 30 subjects so thid variables ranges from 1 to 30) **Factor variable with 30 levels**
* _"activity"_: the activity that each subject did (these were: Laying, Sitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_downstairs, Walking_Upstairs) **Factor Variable with 6 levels**
* _"mean_accelerometer_time_body_x_axis"_: this is the total mean of the x axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
* _"mean_accelerometer_time_body_y_axis"_: this is the total mean of the y axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
* _"mean_accelerometer_time_body_z_axis"_: this is the total mean of the z axis of the mean of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
* _"std_accelerometer_time_body_x_axis"_: this is the total mean of the x axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
* _"std_accelerometer_time_body_y_axis"_: this is the total mean of the y axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
* _"std_accelerometer_time_body_z_axis"_: this is the total mean of the z axis of the standard deviation of the time signals from body registered under the accelerometer grouping by subject and activity. **Numeric variable in seconds**
